### Hi there 👋 I'm Benoît from switzerland.
I started my coding journey beginning of 2022 and I finished Le Wagon Bootcamp last September. I mostly learned Ruby - Ruby on Rails - SQL - HTML - CSS - Javascript. I'm looking forward to finding my first job experience as a web developer to boost my progress.
