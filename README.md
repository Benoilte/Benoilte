### Hi there 👋 I'm Benoît from switzerland.
I started my coding journey beginning of 2022 and I finished Le Wagon Bootcamp on September of the same year. I mostly learned Ruby - Ruby on Rails - SQL - HTML - CSS - Javascript.
In June of 2023 I succeed the 42 school's 'piscine' and just started my new adventure to improve my coding skill with 42 school in Lausanne.
